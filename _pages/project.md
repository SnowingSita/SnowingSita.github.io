# Academic Projects

## DrivenData Challenge: Data Mining the Water Table 
Spring 2019 - CSCI 688 Data Mining
- Implemented classification models using random forest, KNN, and logistic regression
- Performed data cleaning/pre-processing and further analysis in R (packages used: caret)
- Collaborated with other team members through GitHub
- Project repository [https://github.com/egbuck/waterTable](https://github.com/egbuck/waterTable){:target="_blank"}

## Redistricting Police Patrol Zones 
Fall 2018 - CSCI 698 Simulation & Modeling in Operations Research
- Improved the workload min-max ratio between five patrol zones in local county from 1.92 to 1.26
- Simulated local police patrol system in SIMAN language
- Conducted data analysis in R (packages used: dplyr, ggmap, ggplot2, mapview, sp, rgdal, raster)
- Applied time series and geographic information system package to help analyzing the data

## Confidence Region Plotting 
Spring 2018 - CSCI 678 Statistical Analysis of Simulation Models
- Contributed to existing R package conf by adding code for four more uni-variate distributions
- Adapted an existing confidence regions plotting technique and two improvement heuristics
- conf package is available at [https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=conf](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=conf){:target="_blank"}
